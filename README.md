## About Me
- Graduate of Rochester Insitute of Technology (B.S. Computer Science)
- Been programming since I was 12 years old.

## Current Projects
- Implementation of Frank Liang's Stanford Thesis, "Word Hy-Phen-Ation in Com-pu-ters".  
I want to have it set such that I can apply this to search input text and turn it into  
poetry or specific prose that uses syllable counts.
- Refactoring Personal Website from the ground up
- Creating a tool to help me find similar songs to recommend to friends from my extra large playlist (I can't for the life of me understand genre definitions)
- [DONE] NYT Spelling Bee game solver

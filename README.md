## About Me
- B.S. in Computer Science from RIT
- Love being outside (aka "touching grass")
- Trying to make an effort to contribute to more Open Source and my own projects
## Handy Sites and Things
- [Personal Website](https://aidanmellin.github.io)
- [Link to CV](https://aidanmellin.github.io/Aidan_Mellin_Resume.pdf)

## Current Projects
- Implementation of Frank Liang's Stanford Thesis, "Word Hy-Phen-Ation in Com-pu-ters".  
I want to have it set such that I can apply this to search input text and turn it into  
poetry or specific prose that uses syllable counts.
- [DONE] Refactoring Personal Website from the ground up
- [ALMOST DONE] Creating a tool to help me find similar songs to recommend to friends from my extra large playlist (I can't for the life of me understand genre definitions)
- [DONE] NYT Spelling Bee game solver
